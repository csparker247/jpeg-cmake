# IJG's libjpeg (with CMake)
Current Version: `libjpeg 9c (9.3.0)`

## Usage
This project provides drop-in CMake support for the IJG's JPEG library.
Simply run CMake as normal:

```Shell
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake ..
make
```

Alternatively, the important CMake files can be copied to any `libjpeg`
source directory:
```Shell
cp resources/* ~/jpeg-9c/
cd ~/jpeg-9c/
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake ..
make
```

## Updating libjpeg
```Shell
# Delete the contents of the libjpeg subdirectory
cd libjpeg/
rm -rf *

# Copy the source files for libjpeg into the libjpeg subdirectory
cp -a ~/jpeg-9c/ .

# Rerun the CMake build process
cd ../build/
cmake .
make
```

## Advanced Configuration
### Shared and Static Libraries
`jpeg-cmake` emulates the behavior of `libjpeg` and compiles both static and
shared libraries by default. Selective compilation of shared and static
libraries can be controlled with the `BUILD_<SHARED|STATIC>_LIBS` CMake flags:

```Shell
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON ..
```

### Utilities
The `libjpeg` utility programs are built by default. To disable compilation of
these tools, set the `BUILD_EXECUTABLES` flag:
```Shell
cmake -DBUILD_EXECUTABLES=OFF ..
```

By default, executables are linked against the shared libraries. If
static libraries are enabled, executables can optionally be linked statically
by using the `LINK_STATIC` flag:
```Shell
cmake -DLINK_STATIC=ON ..
```

### Tests
The `libjpeg` test targets are generated by default whenever
`BUILD_EXECUTABLES` is enabled. They can be run using the `test` target:
```Shell
cmake ..
make
make test
```

To disable test generation, set the `BUILD_TESTS` flag:
```Shell
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF ..
```

### Customize `jconfig.h`
`libjpeg` provides extensive build customization through modification of `jconfig.h`. To ease this process, `jpeg-cmake` provides many of these
customization options as CMake flags. For example:

```Shell
cmake -DGIF_SUPPORTED=OFF -DPROGRESS_REPORT=ON ..
```

See [`resources/ConfigureJConfig.cmake`](resources/ConfigureJConfig.cmake) for
a complete list of flags and their descriptions.
